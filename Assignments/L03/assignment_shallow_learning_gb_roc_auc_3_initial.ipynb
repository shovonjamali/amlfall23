    "# Assignment - shallow learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi there! In this assignment, you will use shallow learning (including svm, random forests and gradient boosting if you feel up for the challenge) to solve an adapted Question 1 of the winter 2023 exam in applied machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "During the semester you have become very excited about the field of digital pathology which is an area that is developing rapidly due to advancements in microscopy imaging hardware. These advancements have allowed digitizing glass slides into whole-slide images. You have recently read the paper by [Veeling et al (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03962) and you are thrilled to see that the authors have derived a novel dataset, denoted PatchCamelyon (PCam), that will enable you to develop and benchmark your own machine learning models. As Veeling et al (2018) you are primarily interested in developing machine learning models that based on patches of whole-slide images of lymph node sections can assist pathologist in tumor detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this exam is to perform image classification using the PCam dataset. The full dataset consists of 327,680 color images (96x96pxs) extracted from histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. Each image is annotated with a binary label indicating presence of metastatic tissue. For this assignment, however, you are only going to use the subset of the data which have been made available on Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1 (adapted from the exam):\n",
    "Use non-deep learning to perform image classification (tumor detection). Consider among other things the following:\n",
    "1. Support vector machines\n",
    "2. Random forests\n",
    "3. Boosting\n",
    "4. A combination of two or all three of the methods\n",
    "5. Assess the importance of image resolution for the methods you are using\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is posted as a Kaggle competition and is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/t/1f880200648443a3a30878d318cc6e4b\n"
